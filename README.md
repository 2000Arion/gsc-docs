## Running the development server

To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes.

### npm

```sh
npm run start
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn run start
```

### pnpm

```sh
pnpm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

Docusaurus is a modern static website generator so we need to build the website into a directory of static contents and put it on a web server so that it can be viewed.

### npm

```sh
npm run build
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn build
```

### pnpm

```sh
pnpm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## For codespaces

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run start
```
