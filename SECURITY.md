## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate and encourage the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. To report a vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

### 1. Create a confidential issue:

  - Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/2000Arion/gsc-docs/issues) section of this repository.
  - Click the [New Issue](https://github.com/2000Arion/gsc-docs/issues/new/choose) button.
  - Choose [Bug Report](https://github.com/2000Arion/gsc-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yml) for minor, non-security critical bugs where it is fine to make them public immediately. Please use [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/2000Arion/gsc-docs/security/advisories/new) for security critical and confidential bugs and vulnerabilities.
  - Please include a meaningful title.
  - Describe the vulnerability in detail and provide step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce it.

We do not accept third-party bug bounty platforms other than GitHub Advisories.

### 2. Follow-up and communication:

  - We always do our best to investigate and, where possible, fix vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
  - We will provide regular updates on the status of the investigation.
  - When the issue is resolved, we will post details of the fix and credit the reporter upon request.

### 3. Responsible disclosure:

  - We appreciate your discretion and ask that you not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had sufficient time to address it.
  - We strive to address and disclose security issues in a timely manner, but the timeline may vary depending on the complexity of the issue. We will keep you updated on our progress.

**Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!**
